#IC 1st CP2 fractal pattern generator

    #OVERVIEW:
    #Create a Python program that generates a Sierpinski Triangle fractal pattern using recursion. The program should allow users to customize the recursion depth and color of the fractal.

    #PROJECT STEPS:
    #Implement a main function that runs the program and handles user input
    #Create a function to draw the Sierpinski Triangle using recursion
    #Use Python's turtle graphics module for drawing
    #Allow users to specify:
    #Recursion depth (1-5)
    #Triangle color
    #HINT: Remember to implement a base case in your recursive function to prevent infinite recursion!

    #HINT: Use thins image to help you think about HOW to draw this with turtle!

    #OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
    #Welcome to the Sierpinski Triangle Generator! This program creates a Sierpinski Triangle fractal using recursion.

    #Enter recursion depth (1-5): 4

    #Enter triangle color (e.g., red, blue, green): purple

    #Generating Sierpinski Triangle...

    #Fractal generated successfully

    #Press Enter to exit the program.

    #EXTRA CREDIT:
    #Allow the user to save the generated fractal as an image file (3 points)
    #Add an option to change the background color (1 point)
    #Implement a second type of fractal (e.g., Koch Snowflake) (2 points)
