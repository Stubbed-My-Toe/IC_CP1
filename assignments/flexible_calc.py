#available operations= sum, which is x+b. average, which is x+b divided by how many characters. max, which is the highest number. min, which is the lowest. Product which is x*b.

#ask which one.\n

#nums = enter numbers

#for num in nums
    #1+2+3+4+5 etc
    #=bleh

#def average()
#for num in nums, add number and divide by how many numbers there are
    #(1+2+3)/3

#def max()
#what is the highest number in the list?
#organize them by value and pick the index with the highest number

#defmin()
#same asmax, but the smallest number instead

#defproduct()
#product_answ = x*b*c


#while loop

#have them keep putting num in until
#stop when input = done
#call func and do calculation
#ask do you want to go again?
#if input = yes keep going
#reset nums
#else= print thank you for using the calcuator! break
