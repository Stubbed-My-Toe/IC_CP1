#IC 1st Order Up

#Create a program that allows a user to order items off a menu. Menu items need to be stored in a dictionary with their prices as the value. Users need to be able to order a drink, a main course and two side dishes. At the end the program needs to repeat back to the user their full order, and the total cost. 

#Create a dictionary to store the menu items and their prices
#each menu category needs at least 4 options
#prompt the user to select a drink, a main course, and two side dishes
#Validate the user's input to ensure they select valid menu items
#Keep track of the user's order and the total cost
#At the end, display the full order and the total cost
#Implement error handling to handle invalid user input
#Test the program thoroughly to ensure it works as expected
