#we need some way for the user to put in number
input(int("What number do you want for the factorial?"))

#use sys to set higher max terminal digits

#define function Fac()#what?
def fac():

        #if input is = to 1
        #break

    #if input is numeric:
    if 
        #fac()
#print(f"{input} was the original input and {final_num})#what is the answer? And how is it defined? is there some way to store the original input?
